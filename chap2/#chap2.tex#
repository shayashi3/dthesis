\section{$J/\psi$ production process}
$J/\psi$ was discovered in $p$+Be$\rightarrow$$e^{+}e^{-}X$ at AGS and $e^{+}e^{-}$ anihilation at SPEAR in Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in 1974~\cite{bib_jpsifirst1,bib_jpsifirst2}.
$J/\psi$ is a resonance state of $c\bar{c}$ and $J/\psi$ mass is 3.070 GeV/$c^{2}$ slightly higher than 2$m_{c}$. 
$J/\psi$ has spin=1 without the obital angler momentum = 0.   

Production of $J/\psi$ can be classified into two processes, where the first process is the creation of $c\bar{c}$ and the second one is to form $J/\psi$ from $c\bar{c}$ pairs.
Since the mass of charm quarks is expected enough large compared to $\Lambda_{QCD}\sim$ 200 MeV, $c\bar{c}$ production can be descriced by the pertubative QCD calculation.

\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig_2_jpsidiagram} shows the Feynman diagrams of the main $c\bar{c}$ production at LHC energy~\cite{bib_ccbar}. 
The leading order of $c\bar{c}$ production is gluon fusion.
In this process, gluons from each nucleus interact and produce $c\bar{c}$. 
The next-leading order process is the gluon splitting, which scattered gluons split into $c\bar{c}$ pairs.
Another next-leading order process is flavor excitation, where a off-shell quarks produced by the virtual gluon splitting is scattered with a gluon in the other nucleus. 

The several models have been developed to describe $J/\psi$ formation from $c\bar{c}$ pairs such as the colour singlet model (CSM), colour evapolation model (CEM), and Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD)~\cite{bib_csm1,bib_csm2,bib_cem1,bib_cem2}. 
However, for the moment, any model doesn't describe $J/\psi$ production and polarization simultaneously. 

%\subsubsection{Colour Singlet Model (CSM)}
%The colour singlet model (CSM) is assumed that a specific qaurkonium state can be formed if the charm quark anti-charm quark pairis created colour singlet state with the same angler momentum quantum number as $J/\psi$. 
%In this model, hard gluon emission is needed to conserve C-parity. 

%In the leading order gluon fusion process, $J/\psi$ production whose spin number is 1 is suppressed compared to other quarkonia with spin 0 or 2 because gluons have spin 1.

%\subsubsection{Colour Everporation Model (CEM)}
%In this model, the probability of $J/\psi$ formation is independent the colour of $c\bar{c}$ pairs. 
%The colour of $c\bar{c}$ is assumed to be neutralized by the interaction with collision induced colour field. 

%\subsection{Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD)}
%The charmonium can be produced in a colour singlet or colour octet.
%the spin can be singlet or triplet and it can also have orbital angular momentum.

\section{$J/\psi$ production in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions}
Compared to pp collisions, $J/\psi$ undergoes the following effects in heavy ion collisions. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Modification of gluon PDF
  \item Initial state energy loss
  \item Cronin effect
  \item Nuclear absorption
  \item Colour screening
  \item Regeneration in QGP
\end{itemize}
Colour screening is explained in Section.~\ref{sec_2_screening}.
$J/\psi$ regeneration is described in Section.~\ref{sec_2_reco}.
The normal nuclear matter effects are summarized in Section.~\ref{sec_2_normal}.

\section{Colour Screening in QGP and suppression of $J/\psi$}
\label{sec_2_screening}
Matsui and Satz proposed the suppression of $J/\psi$ production as one of the strong evidence of the QGP formation\cite{bib_matsui}. 
The macanisme is based on the Debye screening observed in the electromagnetic plasma. 
At zero temparature, the QCD potential between the quark and anti-quark is expressed by, 
\begin{equation}
V_{QCD}(r) = -\frac{4}{3}\frac{\alpha_{s}(r)}{r}+\sigma r
\label{eq_2_jpsiv}
\end{equation}
where $r$ is the distance between the quark and anti-quark and $\sigma$ is the QCD string tension. 
$\alpha_{s}$ is the gauge coupling constant of QCD described in Section~\ref{sec_1_qcd}. 

Figure~\ref{fig_2_freeenergy} shows the free energy colour singlet quark anti-quark (F(r, T)) calculated by (2+1) lattice QCD~\cite{bib_jpsimodel}.  
The asymptotic value (F($\infty$, T)) corresponding to the energy needed to separate the quark anti-quark pair decrease with increasing temperature. 
\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=10cm]{chap2/figure/Suppression/FreeEnergy.png}
  \caption{Coulor singlet quark-antiquark free energy as a function of quark separation calculated in (2+1) lattice QCD at different temperature~\cite{bib_jpsimodel}.}
  \label{fig_2_freeenergy}
\end{figure}
%If the $\lambda_{D}$ becomes smaller than the hadronic radius, quark-antiquark pairs cannot interact with each other and become unbound. 


As the temperture increases, many free coloured partons are generated and occupy the vacuum. 
The potential of the quark anti-quark pairs is modfied from clomb like potential to Yukawa potential, 
\begin{equation}
  V_{QCD}(r) = -\frac{4}{3}\frac{\alpha_{s}}{r}e^{-\frac{r}{\lambda_{D}(T)}}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_{D}(T)$ is the debye length of the colour screening. 
Qualitatively $\lambda_{D}(T)$ becomes smaller as temperture increases. 
According to lattice calculation, the second term of Eq.~\ref{eq_2_jpsiv} becomes small as temperature increases as following dependence~\cite{bib_tension}, 
\begin{equation}
  \sigma/\sigma_{0} = \sqrt{1-\frac{T}{T_{c}}}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{0}$ is the string tension at T$=$0.
At deconfined phase, second term in Eq.~\ref{eq_2_jpsiv} should be vanished or quite small. 

Lattice calculations and potential models have been adopted to expect the dissociation temperature of each quarkonium. 
Due to the different binding energy, dissociation of quarkonium occurs sequentially towords high temperature. 
Table~\ref{table_2_melt} shows the summary of dissociation temperature $T_{d}$ in unit of $T_{c}$ for each quarkonium calculated by a potential model calculation~\cite{bib_melt}.

  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ccccccccc} \\ \hline

    $T_{d}/T_{c}$ & 2.1 & 1.16 & 1.12 & $\geq 4.0$ & 1.76 & 1.60 & 1.19 & 1.17 \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Dissociation temperature in unit of $T_{c}$ calclated using a potential model\cite{bib_melt}.  }

\section{$J/\psi$ Regeneration}
\label{sec_2_reco}
%The enhancement of barion/meson ratio $\sim$ 1 is observed at in the intermediate $p_{T}\sim$ 3 GeV/c at RHIC\cite{bib_baryonmesonphenix}. 
%This cannot be described via fragmentation process but it can be described by the coalecence of neighboring quarks. 
%If the phase space is fullfilled by the quarks, the coalecence happens and generated hadrons carry the momentum of mother quarks.
The average number of ccbar quarks created in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC and RHIC is about 60 and 10, respectively.
The yield of charmonium from regeneration depends on the ratio of the number of light quarks and charm quarks. 
%The number of $c\bar{c}$ pair production in nucleus-nucleus depends on the number of binary collisions ($N_{coll}$).
%On the other hand, light quark hadron yields are approximately scaled by the number of participants in the overlap region of colliding nuclei. 
%In the glauber calculation, $N_{coll}$ grows rapidly compared to the $N_{part}$ as the centrality of collisions increases. 
%Therefore the enhancement is more significant at central heavy ion collisions than peripheral collisions.  
Production of $c\bar{c}$ as a function of impact parameter (collision centrality) and the production of light hadrons 
scale with the number of binary collision ($N_{coll}$)s and the latter with the number of participants, respectively. 
Participants are defined as the nucleons which exist in the overlap area of colliding nuclei. 
Sine $N_{coll}$ grows faster than $N_{part}$ as a function of centrality, regeneration of $J/\psi$ is more pronounced in more central collisions. 
The regeneration of $J/\psi$ is direct evidence of the formation of deconfied matter. 
At the LHC, where abundant $c\bar{c}$ are created, $J/\psi$ is possibly formed by the regeneration process from uncorrelated $c\bar{c}$ pairs, where $c$ and $\bar{c}$ are created in different nucleon-nucleon collisions,


\section{Normal Nuclear Matter Effects in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions}
\label{sec_2_normal}
\subsection{Modification of Parton Distribution Function inside Nuclei}
The cross section of the hard process between nucleon A and nucleon B is factorized as, 
\begin{equation}
  \sigma_{AB} =  \Sigma_{a, b} \int{dx_{1}}\int{dx_{2}} f^{A}(x_{1})f^{B}(x_{2})\sigma(a_{1}+b_{2})
\end{equation}
where $f^{A}$ and $f^{B}$ are the  parton distribution function (PDF). 
$\sigma(a_{1}+b_{2})$ is the cross section of partonic subprocess between the partons in A and B.
$x$ is a momentum fraction of partons. 
Int 2$\rightarrow$2 process, the relation of x,  rapidy, and energy is expressed by 
\begin{equation}
%  x_{1, 2} = \frac{m_{T}}{\sqrt{s}}e^{\pm y}
  x_{1} = \frac{m_{T}}{\sqrt{s}}(e^{y_{1}}+e^{y_{2}}),  \\
 ~~~  x_{2} = \frac{m_{T}}{\sqrt{s}}(e^{-y_{1}}+e^{-y_{2}}) \\
\end{equation}
where $m_{T}$ is the transverse mass $m_{T}=\sqrt{m^{2}+p_{T}^{2}}$.
%In order to understand the experimental data,  the determination of PDF is crutial. 
%The useful way to determine the PDF is the Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS)
PDF is obtained from the results of DIS and the calculated cross section using perturbative QCD as a function of $x$ and momentum transfer $Q^{2}$~\cite{bib_dis}. 

Europian Muon Collaboration (EMC) group observed the modification of nuclear parton distribution function (nPDF) compared to PDF in the free proton in $\mu+Fe$ scattering in 1982 as shown Fi.g~\ref{fig_2_stfunc}~\cite{bib_emc}. 
The modification of the nPDF from the free proton is evaluated as the ratio of the structure function. 
They discovered the clear modification of the nucler modification factors for heavy ions. 
The right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig_2_stfunc} shows the ratio of the structure function in heavy nuclei and carbon. 
The suppression of $F^{A}_{2}/F^{C}_{2}$ is seen toward smaller $x$.

%For the explanation of the A-A collisions, the modification of nPDF have to understand precicely. 
%In this calculation, the nuclear modification factor defined as following, 
The nuclear modification factor of gluon PDF is introduced as follows:
\begin{equation}
  R^{A}_{i}(x, Q^{2}) = \frac{f^{A}_{i}(x, Q^{2})}{Af^{free}_{i}(x, Q^{2})}
\end{equation}
where $A$ is the mass number of nclei, $f^{free}_{i}$ is un-integrated parton distribution function in the free proton.  

Figure~\ref{fig_2_pdf} show the comparison of model calculation of the gluon nuclear modification factor inside Pb at $Q^{2}=$10 $\rm{GeV^{2}}$.
In Fig.~\ref{fig_2_pdf}, the region $x$ $<$ $10^{-2}$ is called as shadowing region where the nuclear modification factor is below 1. 
The region $10^{-2} < x < 0.3$ is called anti-shadowing region/ %where merged gluons due to the shadowing effect contribute with larger $x$. 
The region above 0.3 is called as EMC region. 

At the LHC energy, the gluon shadowing becomes relevant at midrapidity. 
$c\bar{c}$ production at LHC corresponds to the order of $x\sim$ $10^{-4}-10^{-3}$~\cite{bib_aprv1,bib_aprv2}.

Further small $x$ and small $Q^{2}$ region below the threshold $Q^{2}_{s}$ called the saturation scale, 
gluon saturation is expected to occur~\cite{bib_saturation}.

%\label{sec_2_saturation}

\subsection{Cronin Effect and $k_{T}$ brodening}
It is known that the particle yield at the moderate transeverse momentum enhance in p-A collisions compared to pp collisions~\cite{bib_cronin}.
This is refered as the Cronin effect. 
It is belived to be due to the momentum brodoning caused by the multiple rescattering of the partons in the nucleon inside the nucleus.  
The mean squared transverse momentum $\langle p_{\rm{T}}^{2}\rangle$ depends on the production point
\begin{equation}
  \langle p_{\rm{T}}^{2}\rangle_{pA}(\vm{b}, z) =  \langle k_{T} \rangle ^{2}_{pp} + \langle p_{\rm{T}}^{2}\rangle \sigma_{gN} \int dz\rho_{A}(\vm{b}, z)
\end{equation}
Cronin effects can be approximated by the path length, 
\begin{equation}
  \langle k_{T} \rangle ^{2}_{pA} =   \langle k_{T} \rangle ^{2}_{pp} +  a_{gN}L%\langle\frac{2\mu^{2}L}{\lambda} \rangle
  \label{eq_2_cronin}
\end{equation}
%where $L$ is path length and $a_{gN}$ is expressed as $\frac{2\mu ^{2}}{\lambda}$. 
%where A is the mass number of incident nucleus, L is the path length which corresponds to the Lorentz-contracted longitudial size of the nucleus, and
%$\mu$ is the the amount of the mean momentum transfer in the parton-nucleon scattering. 
%$\lambda$ is the mean free path of the parton in side the nucleus. 

%Howver the only simple multiple scattering model doesn't describe the particle production properly since the experimental results show the dependence on the particle spicies, in particular protons. 
%Figure~\ref{fig_2_chargerppb} shows the measured nucelar modification factor for pion, kaon, protons in p-Pb collision~\cite{bib_chargerppb}. 
%Proton shows the stronger enhanement around 4 GeV/c than other light mesons.
%Equation~\ref{eq_2_cronin} doesn't include any variables related to the produced particle spiciecies since it only estimate the kinematics modification of parton in the nucleous but it doesn't describe the mecanism of hadron production. 
%Therefore additional nuclear matter effects have to be considered in hadronization.

%To describe the data, some theories try to understand this baryon enhancement by regeneration model~\cite{bib_starreco}. 
%They are supported by the fact that other baryons like $\Lambda$ and $\Xi$ also show the stronger enhancement compared to mesons in central p-A collisions~\cite{bib_alicebaryon,_bib_aliceomega}. 
%Figure~\ref{fig_2_baryonratio} shows the baryon/meson ratio as a function of $p_{T}$ in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$5.02 TeV and Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$2.76 TeV. 
%Both of proton and $\Lambda$ shows the enhancements above $p_{T}=$2 in central p-Pb collisions. 
%It is qulitatively consistent of the regeneration picutre. 
%This trend is also similar to the effect of radial flow in the created matters in central p-Pb collisions.

%\end{figure}




\subsection{Partonic Energy Loss inside the nucleus}
\label{sec_2_eloss}
Another initial state effect in heavy ion collisions is the initial state energy loss~\cite{bib_paeloss}. 
In the nuclear medium with the typical size $\sim L$, the medium induced radiative parton energy loss is expected due to the multiple interaction in the nucleus. 
The average medium-induced radiative loss scaling as the quarkonium energy can be $\Delta E \sim E$.
If the formation time 
%which corresponds to the time the scattered partons finish the radiative energy loss 
is shorter than the mean free path, the cronin-like interaction mainly occurs. 
On the other hand, if the formation time is longer than the mean free path, the coherent energy loss known as the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect occurs. 
In QED, this effect suppress medium induced bremsstrahlung radiation compared to the Bethe-Heitler process due to the interference between the next scatterings. 
The similar mecanism is expected in case of QCD process. 
This process can be expected in other nuclear matter effects like gluon shadowing. 


Figure~\ref{fig_2_paeloss} shows the model calculation in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$5 TeV with various nPDF. 
If the modifcation of Parton nPDF is neglected, the enegy loss is expected to suppress the yield by a factor 20\%.

  \label{fig_2_paeloss}
\end{figure}




\subsection{Nuclear Absorption}
$J/\psi$ produced at the iitial parton scattering interacts with the nucleaons in colliding nuclei and some fraction of $J/\psi$ decays into $D\bar{D}$. 
If the crossing time ($\tau_{c}$) of $c\bar{c}$ in the nuclear matter is longer than the formation time of quarkonia, quarkonia forms inside the nucleus and they interact the nucleons.
$\tau_{c}$ is calculated with, 
\begin{equation}
  \tau_{c} = \frac{L}{(\beta_{z}\gamma )}
\end{equation}
where  $\beta_{z}$ is longitudial velocity of $c\bar{c}$. 
This effect describes the data at SPS energy well.
As Lorentz-$\gamma$ factor increases, the crossing time becomes short and quarkonium forms outside the nuclei. 
In this case, this absoption effect is negligible. 


The number of $J/\psi$ which interact annd breack upto $D\bar{D}$ is expressed by 
\begin{equation}
  L\rho_{0}\sigma_{abs}
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the effective path length, $\rho$ is the normal nuclear density, and $\sigma_{abs}$ is the absorption length. 
$L$ is calculated in Glauber model as following with the impact parameter\bm{b}, 
\begin{equation}
  L = \frac{1}{\rho_{0}}\frac{\int T_{A}(\bm{s})  T_{B}(\bm{b}-\bm{s}){A-1}T_{A}(\bm{s})+(B-1)T_{B}(\bm{b}-\bm{s}) d\bm{s} }
  {
    s\int T_{A}(\bm{s})T_{B}(\bm{b}-\bm{s})d\bm{s}    
  }
\end{equation}

Figure~\ref{fig_2_sigmaabs} shows the measured $\sigma_{abs}$ as a function of colission energies\cite{bib_crosstime}. 
As collision energy increases, $\sigma_{abs}$ decrease due to the large $\gamma$ factor.

%\subsection{CERN SPS}

\subsection{SPS Results}
$J/\psi$ has been measured at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) in CERN in S-U, Pb-Pb, and In-In collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}~=$ 19.4, 17.3, and 17.3 GeV, respectively. 
Figure~\ref{fig_2_na50} shows the ratio of measured yield to the Drell-Yang proccess as a function of path length in p-$A$ and $A-A$ collisions ath NA38, NA50, NA51~\cite{bib_na50} since the yield of Drell-Yang process is scaled by $\langle N_{coll} \rangle$. 
p-$A$ result show the common trend due to the normal nuclear matter effects. 
From this depndence, the nuclear absorption cross section $\sigma_{abs}$ of $J/\psi$ was determined to be $\sigma_{abs}~=$ 4.2 $\pm$ 0.5 mb. 
%The solid curve shows the expected ratio including nuclear absorption. 
Figure~\ref{fig_2_na50} shows the ratio of measured cross section of $J/\psi$ and the expected yield as a function of path length $L$ in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}~=$ 17.3 and 19.4 GeV at NA38, and NA50, respectively. 
The result show the clear suppression as $L$ increases in particular less bound state $\psi$. 
The nucleus crossing time ($\tau_{c}\sim$ 0.3 fm/c) is compatible or larger than the charmonium formation time.
%At large path length, stronger suppression is observed than the normal nuclear matter effects.

%Further measurements at HERAB and FNAL, it is indicated the slope of Cronin parametrization is independent of collision energy.

\subsection{E866 at Tevatron}
The E866 at Tevatron in Felmi National LaAccelerator Laboratory (FNAL) has a wide Feynmann $x$ couverage at -0.1 $<$ $x_{F}$ $<$ 0.93. 
Feynmann-$x$ is defined as the longitudinal momentum transfer fraction, 
\begin{equation}
  x_{F}  = x_{1}-x_{2}
\end{equation}
%where $p_{L}$ is the longitudial momentum. 
E866 evaluates the nuclear matter effecs with parameter $\alpha$ defined as, 
\begin{equation}
  \sigma^{J/\psi}_{AB} = \sigma^{J/\psi}_{NN}(AB)^{\alpha}
\end{equation}
where $A$ and $B$ are the mass number of colliding nuclei. 
$\sigma^{J/\psi}_{AB}$ is the $J/\psi$ cross section in $A$-$B$ collisions and $\sigma^{J/\psi}_{NN}$ is the $J/\psi$ cross section in nucleon-nucleon collisions. 
Figure~\ref{fig_2_e866} shows the measured $\alpha$ as a function of $x_{F}$ in p-$A$ (p-Fe, p-W) collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}~=$ 38.8 GeV. 

E866 observed $J/\psi$ suppression at high $x_{F}$ region in p-Fe and p-W collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}~=$ 38.8 GeV. 
At low $x_{F}$, $\alpha $ is saturated to 0.96 $\pm$ 0.01. 
%At low $x_{F}$, quarkonium forms inside the nucleus. 
One possibility to describe the suppression at high $x_{F}$ is a partonic interaction inside the nucleus since charmonium is expected to form outside the nucleus at high $x_{F}$ limit.

\subsection{RHIC}
\subsubsection{d+Au Collisions}
\label{sec_d_dau}
The left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig_2_jpsiparhic} shows the comparison of $J/\psi$ production between the measured results and the calculation based on the nuclear shadowing and thg gluon saturation  at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$200 GeV~\cite{bib_paeloss}. 
The results show the suppression of $J/\psi$ production in whol measured  rapidity region. 
Shadowing $+$ hadron break up model describes $y$ dependence. 
However the $p_{T}$ dependence of $R_{\rm{dAu}}$. 

The right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig_2_jpsiparhic} shows the comparison of $J/\psi$ production between experimental data from RHIC and energy loss model calculation with various nPDF assumptions in d+Au collision at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$200 GeV~\cite{bib_paeloss}. 
The model shows the nPDF depedence in particular considering EPS09 PDF especialy backward. 
It is thought the difference of strenth of the anti-shadowing region ($x\sim ~10^{-1}$) as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_2_pdf}.
Within the uncertainty of the nPDF, the energy loss model show the reasonable agreement at midrapidity and forward rapidty.

The mechanism of normal nuclear matter effects in d+Au collisions at RHIC is still  under discussion. 

\subsubsection{Au-Au collisions}
Figure~\ref{fig_2_rhicjpsiaa} show the nuclear modification factor of $J/\psi$ at mid-rapidity and forward rapidity in Au-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$200 GeV. 
The lower panel of Fig.~\ref{fig_2_rhicjpsiaa} shows the ratio of forward/mid nuclear modification factor.  
At $N_{part} > $100, the ratio is constant $\sim$ 0.6. 
It looks inconsitent with $J/\psi$ suppression picture because the energy density at mid-rapidity is expected higher than that at forward rapidity. 
This result may suggest the existence of $J/\psi$ regeneration at RHIC.

\section{Normal Nuclear Effects at LHC}

The crossing time at LHC is expected $\sim$ $10^{-2}$ fm/$c$.
Since it is shorter than the quarkonia formation time, the nuclear absorption is expected negligible.

\section{Normal Nuclear Matter Effects on ALICE }
Due to the large $\gamma$ factor at LHC, short crossing time of $c\bar{c}$ in the nuclear matter is expected.
Crossing time is calculated by, 
\begin{equation}
  \tau_{c} = \frac{L}{\gamma}
\end{equation}

The nuclear absorption might be  negligible at LHC energy and the modification of nPDF is expected more crucial. 

From the previous measurements at SPS, Tevatron, RHIC, the normal matter effects which
