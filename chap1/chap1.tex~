\section{Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)}
\label{sec_1_qcd}
Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is a local SU(3) gauge theory and describes the strong interaction of quarks and gluons. 
Quarks and gluons have color charge and they interact by strong force. 
The Lagrangian of QCD is expressed by, 
\begin{equation}
  L_{QCD} = \bar{\psi_{q}^{i}}( i\gamma^{\mu}(D_{\mu})_{ij} - m\delta_{ij} ) \psi_{q}^{j} - \frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}^{a}F_{a}^{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
where $\psi^{i}_q$ is the quark field with color index $i$, $\gamma^{\mu}$ is a Dirac matrix, $m_{q}$ is the quark mass. 
$F^{a}_{\mu\nu}$ is the gluon field strength tensor with gluon colour index. 
$D_{\mu ij}$ is the covariant derivative of QCD expressed by, 
\begin{equation}
  (D_{\mu})ij = \delta_{ij}\partial_{\mu} - ig_{s}t^{a}_{ij}A^{a}_{\mu}
\end{equation}
where $g_{s}$ is the strong coupling constant, and $A^{a}_{\mu}$ is gluon field with gluon colour index a. 
In QCD, the coloured state is prohibited to exist and quarks and gluons are confined in colour-singlet hadrons at low energy ("quark confinement''). 
The strong coppling constant $\alpha_{s}=g_{s}^{2}/4\pi$ can be expressed as a function of the mometum transfer ($Q^{2}$), 
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_{s}(Q^{2}) = \frac{12\pi}{(33-2n_{f})ln(Q^{2}/\Lambda^{2}_{QCD})}
\end{equation}
% pQCD is valid
where $N_{f}$ is the number of quark flavors, $\Lambda_{QCD}\sim$ 200 MeV is the typical QCD scale. 
If $Q^{2} >> \Lambda_{QCD}^{2}$, the $\alpha_{s}$ becomes small. 
This feature is called "assymptonic freedom''. 
Figure~\ref{fig_1_alphas} shows the $\alpha_{s}$ measuments as a function of Q~\cite{bib_pdg}.

\section{Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP)}
Due to the assymtonic freedom, it is anticipated that the confinement may be broken in high temperture or high density matter and the phase transition occurs to  deconfimed state called as quark-gluon plasma (QGP). 
The lattice calculation predict the critical temperature ($T_{c}$) of the phase transition to QGP is 150-200 MeV. 
Figure~\ref{fig_1_lattice} shows the calcurated result of the entropy density $s/T^{3}$ as a function of temperature $T$~\cite{bib_slattice}.  
The entropy increases close to the Steffen-Boltzmann limit rapidly around 200 MeV due to the increase of the degree of freedom.
The increase of degree of freedom is attirubuted by the creation of deconfiend state composed of quarks and gluons. 
%Figure~\ref{fig_1_lattice} shows the results of the (2+1) lattice calculation on the pressure (3p/$T^{4}$), energy density($\epsilon/T^{4}$), and entropy density ($3s/4T^{3}$) as a function of temperature.
%This model take into account two light quark flavor with the same mass and one heavy flavor tuned to match the $\eta_{s\bar{s}}$ mass. 
%In the ideal gas limit, the system obeys Steffen-Boltzmann low and these values become constant. 
%The yellow band in Fig.~\ref{fig_1_lattice} shows the crossover region around the critical temperature 145 $<$ $T$ $<$ 164 MeV.
%Below 150 MeV, the results show the agreement to the hadron resonanace gas aproximation. 
%The discripancy between two aproximation is shown above 170 MeV. 
%They are not saturated at higher temperature but the energy density and the etropy density increase rapidly around $T_{c}$ due to the increase of the degree of freedom by the transition from the hadronic matter to the partonic matter.

%The lattice calculation of QCD predicts that the phase transition occurs around the critical temperature $T_{c}\sim$ 150-200 MeV. 
%Figure~\ref{} shows the calculated result of the entropy density as a fuction of temperature. 
%The entropy density increases  at $T\sim$ 200 MeV due to the increase of the degree of freedom, which imply the existence of the de-confined state. 


\section{Relativistic Energy Heavy Ion Collisions}
Relativistic heavy ion collisions is thought as the unique tool to create the QGP in the laboratory.
For example, the initial energy density of Pb-Pb collisions at LHC calculated by the Bjorken fomula is $\epsilon_{0}\sim$ 135 GeV/$\rm{fm}^{3}$~\cite{bib_bjorken}. 
%$A$ is the transeverse are and $c\tau_{0}$ is longitudial length of the considered initial 
%$\tau_{0}$ is assumed 0.08 fm.
It is much higher than the expected QGP threshold ($<$ 1 GeV/$\rm{fm}^{3}$).
The temperature is expected to reach up to 4$T_{c}$.
Therefore it is belived that QGP is created in relativistic heavy ion collisions. 

The first experiment of the relativistic heavy ion collisions is performed at Bevalac in Lawrence Berkeley in the middle of 1970â€™s.
It is a Fixed-taget experimen with the energy per nucleon of 2 A GeV.  
In 1980's, the experiments at the Alternating Gradient Synchrotorn (AGS) in Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) in European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) started with the beam energy per nucleon of $\sim$ 14A GeV and $\sim$ 160A GeV, respectively. 
The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in BNL is the first collider for the relativistic heavy ion collisions. 
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in CERN provides heavy ion collisions since 2010.  

Figure~\ref{fig_1_hic} shows the schematic view of the space-time evolusion of heavy ion collisions~\cite{bib_spacetime}. 
\begin{figure}[!h]

  \caption{Space and Time evolusion in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The z-axis express the beam direction. $\tau_{0}$ is the formation time of QGP. $T_{c}$, $T_{ch}$ ,$T_{fo}$ denote critical temperature, chemical freezeout temperature, and kinematical freezeout temperature, respectively~\cite{bib_spacetime}.}
  \label{fig_1_hic}
\end{figure}
The space-time evolution of heavy ion collisions can be separated into the initial stage before collisions, pre-equilibrium stage, equilibrium stage (QGP) and expansion of the QGP, hadronic gas phase, chemical freezeout, and kinematical freezeout.
When chemical freezeout happens, the relative particle ratio of hadrons are fixed although generated hadrons interact each other. 
At the kinetic freezeout,  the momentum distribution of hadrons is fixed and hadrons are emitted from the matter.  
It is assumed that the space-time evolution is depdendent on only the proper time $\tau=\sqrt{t^{2}-z^{2}}$ at high energy limit. 
When the nuclei collide at $\tau=$0, a large number of collisions occur in the overlap region of incident nuclei and huge amount of energy is depositted in a small volume. 

\begin{description}
\item[Initial Stage] \mbox{}\\
It is non-trivial that heavy-ion collisions can be described by the superposition of nucleon-nucleon collisions due to the existence of normal nuclear effects as described in Chapter2.
%This initial nucleus-nucleus collisions cannot is not exactly same as the superposition of the nucleon-nucleon collisions because of nuclear matter effecs described in Chapter~\ref{chap_phys}.
The system is not thermalized at this points.

\item[Pre-equilibrium stage] \mbox{} \\


\item[equilibrium stage (QGP) and expansion of the QGP] \mbox{} \\
Once the system become thermalized, the expansion of the system can be described by the relativistic hydorodynamics. 
During the collective expansion of the system, the temperature drops and if it crosses the $T_{c}$, hadrons are generated 

\item[Hadron gas phase] \mbox{} \\




The deconfined partons produced in the initial scattering are strongly coupled and the system is expected to reach to the local equilibium at $\tau = \tau_{0}$ in a very short time $<$ 1 $fm/c$.
If the temuperture is above the $T_{c}$, QGP is formed. 

\end{description}

 
RHIC and LHC provides many signs of the QGP formation such as $J/\psi$ suppression and large anisotropic flow\cite{bib_jpsiaarhic}. 
However, in order to extract QGP signal from the experimental data, whole understanding of the space-time evolution of the heavy ion collision is needed. 




\section{Objective and Organization of Thesis}
$J/\psi$ has been considered as one of the good probes to discuss the formation of the QGP.
As is described in Chapter 2, attraction between $c$ and $\bar{c}$ quarks is reduced by Color Debye screening in QGP and thus $J/\psi$ is not formed in the QGP.
In addition to the color screening effect in the QGP, normal nuclear matter effects such as the gluon shadowing play a role to modify the $J/\psi$ production in heavy-ion collisions. 
Understanding of the normal nuclear matter effects is mandatory for the understanding of the QGP effects to the $J/\psi$ production in heavy-ion collisions.
In this thesis, $J/\psi$ production in p-Pb collisions at the LHC is measured and normal nuclear effects to the $J/\psi$ production is described.

The organization of this thesis is as follows.  
In Chapter~\ref{chap_phys}, the physics background related to this thesis is summarized. 
In Chapter~\ref{chap_setup}, the LHC complex and the detector setup of the ALICE expriment is described. 
In Chapter~\ref{chap_ana}, the analysis of $J/\psi\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$5.02 TeV is explained. 
In Chapter~\ref{chap_dis}, experimental results and their interpretation are discussed. 
The conclusion of this thesis is summarized in Chapter~\ref{chap_con}
